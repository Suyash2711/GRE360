# GRE360
### About the Project -
The need for an application to help students prepare for their GRE examinations in one place is a daunting one. We are proposing this application to tackle this very problem. Gre360 achieves this very gracefully by the implementaion of multiple mock tests along with a sofisticated Machine Learning model to help students understand their chances of getting into top universities.

## Built With

- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: NodeJS, MongoDB
- Machine Learning: Sci-Kit Learn, Flask, Matplotlib, Keras, Pandas

## Team Name
>Cruser Blade

## Domain
Education

## Quick Start

- Fork and Clone the repo using

```
